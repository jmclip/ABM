# ABM

This is a basic overview to getting started in Agent-Based Modeling. There are slides (ABMs.rmd and ABMs.html), then two model files. Schell1 is a simplified version of Schelling's Segregation model while schell2 is a more complex version. 

## Schelling's segregation model
Schelling's segregation model begins with a simple set of premises: what if agents / individuals could live anywhere, are of two groups, and have some preference for neighbors to be members of their same group? Permitting for this, we can observe that agents segregate themselves into quite homogenous neighborhoods with preferences starting as low as wanting 37% of their neighbors to be members of their same group. 

## What to expect
In each step of the model, agents look to their immediate neighbors (8 squares surrounding the agent) and calculate what proportion of these agents are of the same type as the agent. If this proportion is below their threshold, the agent stays in place; otherwise, the agent moves to a new random space on the grid. 

### Schell 1 vs Schell 2
There are two versions of the Schelling model. The models were loosely based upon the [Schelling example available here in the Mesa example repo](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/main/examples/schelling), but some substantial functional changes were made. 

#### Schell1 
This model is the basic version of the Schelling segregation model. Agents are initialized and move around the world. There are two main global measures (overall agent happiness and overall average segregation in agent immediate surroundings). In the data export, there are also trackers for different types of agents and their group level values (happiness by group, average neighborhood segregation by group). 

#### Schell2
In this model, we complicate the model in Schell1 a bit by allowing the two groups to have their own intolerance levels. Meaning, each group has a potentially different preference for the propotion of the smiilarity of their neighbors. 

## Files
Slides for the presentation are avaiable under ABMs_slides.
Within each of the two models (schell1 and schell2), you'll find the following files:
- model.py *this is the bulk of the model and includes the agent and model classes*
- server.py *this is how the model runs are visualized*
- run.py *run this file to run the model in the gui and exports the results to a csv*
- run_single.py *this allows for a single run, bypassing the gui, and exports the results to a csv*
- run_batch.py *(for schell2) this allows you to run multiple iterations and / or run the model with different parameter value combinations, and exports the results to a csv*

# How to run this model:
You can either download the zipped file from this repo or you can go to [this Google Colab notebook for Schell1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11shBk82BSt6WnDA_64HAW0haok6fLwTk#scrollTo=BlZ1knJYPMjb) and run the model from there. For Google Colab, you won't need to download anything. 

If you have python downloaded on your machine already and want to run the files locally, see below.

## Running the model from downloaded files
If you want to run the model after you download the files, you can either run it directly in your IDE of choice (e.g. PyCharm), or you can run it from the command line in terminal. 

### Running the Gui on your machine from terminal
First, install Mesa:

```
!pip install mesa
```

Download the file, change your directory to the model of your choice (schell1 or schell2). Then, run the following code:

```
python run.py
```

This should automatically open a browser window at [http://127.0.0.1:8500/](http://127.0.0.1:8500/). You can then adjust the parameters from there. 

### Single and batch runs on your machine
The process is the same for these as above with the code for each differing. You can edit the files to change the initial parameter values. The key distinction is that there won't be a GUI interface. The code you run will be either

```
python run_single.py
```

or 

```
python run_batch.py
```


The model will run and export the data to a file called 'data'. Note that in either case, if you call these files multiple times, the data file will be overwritten.
