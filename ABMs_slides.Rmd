# Intro & agenda  
Today we'll cover the foundations of getting started in modeling, giving an overview of models, their uses and applications, and how they might feature into a course. 

--
 - Talk context
 - Intro to Agent-Based Models
 - Model components
 - Application (Schelling)
 - Adapting models / varying parameters
 - Course framing
 - Conclusions


---
# Talk context / some assumptions:

- You may not have seen an agent-based model (or have only heard of it)

--

- This talk will be conceptually connected to how we'd build ideas in a course but more of a **stylized version**.

- In the interest of time, **I won't go into as much detail as I typically would in a course.** We're also going to sacrifice some interactive coding. 

---
# What is an Agent-Based Model (ABM)?
ABMs allow you to focus on 

1. the evolution of behavior / system and 

2. explicitly engage with heterogeneous actors. 

--
<br>
.center[
.color-box-rosy[
In contrast to other types of models, **ABMs permit heterogeneous agents who can have different experiences** and allow you to explore system-level effects, the path to equilibrium, and **emergent phenomena.**]]
 
---
# ABMs vs. other models:

- **Linear Regression**: focus upon large-scale relationships instead of individual-level factors.

--

- **Systems Dynamics**: focus on the system from a high level; typically need an understanding of the equations governing the system. 

--

- **Game Theory**: can look at final equilibrium of the system, without information about what occurs on the way there nor how long it will take. 

--

- **ABM**: 'Bottom-up' approach using simple assumptions, analyzes how the system behaves and emergent phenomena that result from the model.  


---
# ABM setup and components: 
### Who does what, how? <br>

--
- **Actors** these can be people, animals, businesses, etc. The *units* you care about.

--

- **Parameters** (AKA *variables*) these are the things you're going to vary.

--

- **Framework**  structure for interaction. 
  -Structure ecosystem / environment for actor.
  - Define movement / behavior (where are they placed, how they interact, move, etc.). 

---

# Applications
ABMs allow you to evaluate situations from relatively simple initial conditions and have broad applications.

- **Political Science** emergence of markets (Padgett), effects of institutional change (Bednar/Page)
- **Sociology** neighborhood segregation, evolution of cultural groups (Axelrod).
- **Economics** tragedy of the commons (Hardin), market bubbles.
- **Ecology** flocking, predator/prey models, ecosystems.
- **Epidemiology** pandemic modeling (Zelner), health disparities, public health policy analysis.

# Example: Schelling's segregation model
Today, we're going to go over a classic model that is intuitive to understand, somewhat surprising in its findings, and easily customizable: Schelling's segregation model. 



---
# Example: Schelling's segregation model

- The model seeks to **explore why we might see stark segregation**, even if focusing *solely* on actor behavior / motivation between two groups, and assuming somewhat benign intentions (no explicit dislike / hatred).

--

- Schelling's model is** *one piece* in exploring and understanding patterns** we see in housing markets and neighborhood patterns. 

- Rothstein's [Color of Law](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-color-of-law-a-forgotten-history-of-how-our-government-segregated-america/) is great additional reading.

# Schelling's model: file structure

Alternatives: Jupityr notebook, Google Colab, or IDE of choice. 

- **Framework** for running the ABM: [Mesa](https://pypi.org/project/Mesa/) 
    - [Documentation at this link](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/)
- **File structure**: start with three files.
  - *Model*: actualize agents and their environment.
  - *Server*: visualize the model.
  - *Run*: run the model(not always necessary for simple models but good to build the habit now!).
  - *README*: file with a model overview.

## KEEP IT SIMPLE

---
# Designing the model: model file structure
In the interest of time, we'll focus on the model file. We'll need to think about our agents, what they can do, and how. 

--

You'll have two main classes: your **agent class** (can divide up by type) and the **model class**. 

---
# Designing the model: model file structure

- Import Mesa and anything else you'll need.
- **Agent class**: 
  - Initialize properties within the agents (e.g. happiness).
  - Define what happens for an agent within a time step.
- **Model class**:  
  - Define model-level parameter values (e.g. desired similarity level).
  - Define what happens at the model level in a time step (e.g. run the model until all agents are happy).
  - Collect data.

# Complicating the model
We might think that while simple, we've sacrificed *too much* and we want to recapture some of the complexity of the situation. Let's consider ways we might complicate this model in a meaningful way: 
--

+ **Types** of agents (could consider multiple types).
+ **Sensitivity** of agents (some are more/less tolerant).
+ **Initialization** of the model (could think about 'geographic' placement of actors/agents).
+ Additional **attributes** of actors (e.g. wealth).

---
# Complicating the model: 
**Agent sensitivity / tolerance** 
There are many ways we could think about agent sensitivity / tolerance: The big focus might be across or within group tolerance. 

--

- **Across group tolerance** Here, our concern is whether the two groups have similar levels of tolerance. 

- **Within group tolerance** Here, our concern is whether the agents within each group have the same tolerance threshold.

**Predict what you think will happen** - *in particular, consider how the other parameter values (proportion of group size, density) may also contribute.*

# Output/analysis: model metrics
Here is some (not that pretty) output we get.We could clean this up, but it's still a graphic and difficult to include in other work.  

```{r, out.width= "75%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/schell_happy_ex.png")
```

---
# Exploring your output beyond the GUI
You might want nicer graphics from one or multiple runs. In these cases, you'll want to export your data. 
--
There are multiple ways you might do this -- I added separate files to allow you to 

1. **Export the data** from the specific run in the gui, 
2. bypass the gui and just do a single run, 
3. Do a **batch run** where you run the model multiple times and to get a sense of trends, 
or 
4. Do a **parameter sweep** where you explore how varying the parameters may lead to different outcomes
5. Do a **batch run of parameter sweeps**

# Batch Runs / Parameter Sweeps
These models come from a process with stochastic elements. To explore what happens overall, you might want to either **run your model multiple times and/or do multiple parameter sweeps** where you explore the relationships between changing a variable and the outcome. 

--

**Parameter sweeps** usually involve varying one or two parameters across key values.

# Applications: Housing  

Schelling's model can help us understand what we observe around us, and help us further **explore implications for neighborhood change**.

Future complications and explorations of Schelling's model might **explore how to incorporate the delay and cost into moving** to better anticipate how, for example, Minneapolis' planned 2040 ban on single-family zoning.

# Recap: what are ABMs?
--

- ABMs offer **flexibility to explore individually-driven analyses and simulations**
--

- ABMs are structured around:
  - Agents.
  - Models/the world you setup.

--
- Data can be collected on a run-by-run basis.

--
- You can (and should) do multiple runs of your model across multiple parameter values. 


---
# Course framing
This was an excerpt and condensation of a course on ABM. Below I provide a loose course outline.

# Applications & Connections to Research
### What could we learn from such a simple model? 

One application can be thinking about **gentrification**, for example in how we see neighborhoods changing over time. **Schelling's model helps us understand that having a low threshold for similar neighbors can produce staggering levels of segregation,** without even accounting for institutional structures that can entrench housing / employment practices or otherwise amplify and perpetuate differences across groups. 

---
# Applications & Connections to Research
### What could we learn from such a simple model? 

What we found in our initial simulations is that about 1/3 tends to be a cutoff or threshold for seeing segregation in neighborhoods. **In established neighborhoods, would this threshold also drive change?**

--

Hwang and Sampson (2014) found that there is **indeed a 'threshold cutoff' for gentrification that appears to be around 40%.** Comparing that to the simple Schelling segregation model, 40% is just over 3/8 neighbors being from a different group.
